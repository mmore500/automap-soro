# automap-soro

Built using the [evosoro](https://github.com/skriegman/evosoro) soft robot simulator.
Evosoro was designed and developed by the [Morphology, Evolution & Cognition Laboratory](http://www.meclab.org), University of Vermont. 
The library is built on top of the open source [VoxCAD](https://github.com/jonhiller/VoxCAD
) and the underlying voxel physics engine ([Voxelyze](https://github.com/jonhiller/Voxelyze)) which were both developed by the [Creative Machines Lab](http://www.creativemachineslab.com/), Columbia University.
